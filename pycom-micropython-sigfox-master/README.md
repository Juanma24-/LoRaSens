The MicroPython project
=======================

</p>

This is the MicroPython project, which aims to put an implementation
of Python 3.x on microcontrollers and small embedded systems.
You can find the official website at [micropython.org](http://www.micropython.org).

WARNING: this project is in beta stage and is subject to changes of the
code-base, including project-wide name changes and API changes.

MicroPython implements the entire Python 3.4 syntax (including exceptions,
"with", "yield from", etc., and additionally "async" keyword from Python 3.5).
The following core datatypes are provided: str (including basic Unicode
support), bytes, bytearray, tuple, list, dict, set, frozenset, array.array,
collections.namedtuple, classes and instances. Builtin modules include sys,
time, and struct, etc. Select ports have support for _thread module
(multithreading). Note that only subset of Python 3.4 functionality
implemented for the data types and modules.

See the repository www.github.com/micropython/pyboard for the MicroPython
board (PyBoard), the officially supported reference electronic circuit board.

Major components in this repository:
- py/ -- the core Python implementation, including compiler, runtime, and
  core library.
- unix/ -- a version of MicroPython that runs on Unix.
- exp32/ -- a version of MicroPython that runs on the ESP32 based boards from Pycom.
- stmhal/ -- a version of MicroPython that runs on the PyBoard and similar
  STM32 boards (using ST's Cube HAL drivers).
- minimal/ -- a minimal MicroPython port. Start with this if you want
  to port MicroPython to another microcontroller.
- tests/ -- test framework and test scripts.
- docs/ -- user documentation in Sphinx reStructuredText format.

Additional components:
- bare-arm/ -- a bare minimum version of MicroPython for ARM MCUs. Used
  mostly to control code size.
- teensy/ -- a version of MicroPython that runs on the Teensy 3.1
  (preliminary but functional).
- pic16bit/ -- a version of MicroPython for 16-bit PIC microcontrollers.
- cc3200/ -- a version of MicroPython that runs on the CC3200 from TI.
- esp8266/ -- an experimental port for ESP8266 WiFi modules.
- tools/ -- various tools, including the pyboard.py module.
- examples/ -- a few example Python scripts.

The subdirectories above may include READMEs with additional info.

"make" is used to build the components, or "gmake" on BSD-based systems.
You will also need bash and Python (at least 2.7 or 3.3).

The ESP32 version
-----------------

The "esp32" port requires an xtensa gcc compiler, which can be downloaded from
the Espressif website:

- for 64-bit Linux::

    https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux64-1.22.0-61-gab8375a-5.2.0.tar.gz

- for 32-bit Linux::

    https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux32-1.22.0-61-gab8375a-5.2.0.tar.gz

- for Mac OS:

    https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-osx-1.22.0-61-gab8375a-5.2.0.tar.gz

To use it, you will need to update your ``PATH`` environment variable in ``~/.bash_profile`` file. To make ``xtensa-esp32-elf`` available for all terminal sessions, add the following line to your ``~/.bash_profile`` file::

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin

Alternatively, you may create an alias for the above command. This way you can get the toolchain only when you need it. To do this, add different line to your ``~/.bash_profile`` file::

    alias get_esp32="export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin"

Then when you need the toolchain you can type ``get_esp32`` on the command line and the toolchain will be added to your ``PATH``.

You also need the ESP IDF along side this repository in order to build the ESP32 port.
To get it:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pycom/pycom-esp-idf.git

After cloning, make sure to checkout all the submodules:

    $ cd pycom-esp-idf
    $ git submodule update --init

Finally, before building, export the IDF_PATH variable

    $ export IDF_PATH=~/pycom-esp-idf
	
Prior to building the main firmware, you need to build mpy-cross

	$ cd mpy-cross && make clean && make

To build and flash your LoPy for 868MHz regions:

    $ cd esp32
    $ make BOARD=LOPY TARGET=boot clean
    $ make BOARD=LOPY TARGET=boot
    $ make BOARD=LOPY LORA_BAND=USE_BAND_868 TARGET=app
    $ make BOARD=LOPY LORA_BAND=USE_BAND_868 flash

or for 915MHz regions:

    $ cd esp32
    $ make BOARD=LOPY TARGET=boot clean
    $ make BOARD=LOPY TARGET=boot
    $ make BOARD=LOPY LORA_BAND=USE_BAND_915 TARGET=app
    $ make BOARD=LOPY LORA_BAND=USE_BAND_915 flash

or the WiPy 2.0:

    $ cd esp32
    $ make BOARD=WIPY TARGET=boot
    $ make BOARD=WIPY TARGET=app
    $ make BOARD=WIPY flash

or the SiPy:

    $ cd esp32
    $ make BOARD=SIPY TARGET=boot
    $ make BOARD=SIPY TARGET=app
    $ make BOARD=SIPY flash

Make sure that your board is placed into programming mode, otherwise flahing will fail.
To do this, connect ``P2`` to ``GND`` and then reset the board.

To specify a serial port other than /dev/ttyUSB0, use ESPPORT variable:

    $ make BOARD=WIPY ESPPORT=/dev/tty.usbserial-DQ008HQY flash
